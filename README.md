# Students’ Early Attrition Modelling for Clearwater State University

The project aims  to identify the key drivers of early attrition and build a predictive model to identify students with higher early attrition risk, based on the data related to student’s demographic profile, course preferences, performance record, grades, financial background, financial aid and other application information.
